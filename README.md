# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project


### Purpose
Provide an analysis of Kickstarter campaigns to determine campaign outcomes in relation to launch dates and funding goals. Visualizations and results are shared to understand similar Kickstarter campaigns and to inform Louise of the best path forward.

## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis was performed on Kickstarter campaign data provided via Excel to help Louise investigate outcomes of campaigns similar to hers. Data for a wide variety of campaign categories is presented, creating a large and challenging dataset. I focused on subsets of the data in an effort to provide the best comparison to Louise's Kickstarter for her play *Fever*.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
     1. The highest number of successful theater campaigns on Kickstarter were launched in May, June and July.
     2. A similar number of theater campaigns fail each month.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? The campaign goal does not appear to be predictive of the outcome.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
